# Automated-Piece-Transfer-System-Using-a-Transfer-Cart-Simulation-and-Control-with-Step7-and-FluidSIM
This project focuses on the design, simulation, and automation of a system for transferring pieces between two workstations using a transfer cart. Developed as part of our embedded electronic systems and control engineering program, the system integrates pneumatic actuators, sensors, and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to optimize industrial handling operations.

Key Features:
Automated and Cycle-by-Cycle Modes: The system supports both fully automatic operation and manual cycle-by-cycle control.

Pneumatic Simulation: The project includes a detailed simulation of pneumatic circuits using FluidSIM Pneumatic, modeling the behavior of actuators representing conveyor belts and an electromagnet.

PLC Programming: The control logic is implemented in Step7, featuring a GRAFCET diagram to define the sequence of operations.

Sensor-Actuator Integration: The system uses sensors to detect piece presence and actuator positions, ensuring precise and reliable transfers.

Technologies Used:
Software: Siemens Step7 (PLC programming), FluidSIM Pneumatic (pneumatic circuit simulation).

Hardware: Simulated pneumatic actuators (cylinders), sensors, and a CPU 313C-2 DP PLC.

Project Outcomes:
Successful simulation of the transfer process, validating the theoretical design.

Demonstration of how industrial automation can enhance efficiency and safety in material handling.

This repository includes the project report, GRAFCET diagrams, Step7 code, and FluidSIM simulation files. Ideal for students and professionals interested in industrial automation, PLC programming, and pneumatic systems.
